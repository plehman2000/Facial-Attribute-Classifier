# Facial Attribute Classifier

This is a CNN classifier based on the CelebA High Quality Facial Attribute Dataset (https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) and implemented using PyTorch. This was produced in conjunction with @nyehuda and @kieranos45 for our Deep Learning for Computer Graphics course project. We also are grateful to the University of Florida for giving us GPU resources on the HiperGator, which we used to train and experiment with this model.
